## Project Approach

The approach to this project is to have a systematic segregation of database and reduction of nested data to ensure optimize performance in retrieving data. The approach to databases is to have 4 seperate databases (user, meme, pun, gif) with each database connected by a username key value pair. 

The project also aim to achieve as minimum view state as possible to reduce rendering time and optimize data fetching time.
The project will be split up into 3 main contents, tackled by a single person with a universal methodology to achieve minimum conflict and faster building time.

4) Design dashboard page (segmented by memes / puns / gif)
5) Design 1 user dashboard page (segmented by memes / puns / gif)
6) Design workflow ( CRUD )
7) Test and troubleshooting
8) Bonus ( if have time)
9) Deployment of app
